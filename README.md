With tweakcc, you can

- Customize all of Claude Code's **system prompts** (**NEW:** also see [**Claude Code System Prompts**](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/claude-code-system-prompts))
- Create custom **toolsets** that can be used in Claude Code with the new **`/toolset`** command
- Manually name **sessions** in Claude Code with `/title my chat name` or `/rename`
- Create **custom themes** with a graphical HSL/RGB color picker
- Add custom **thinking verbs** that will show while Claude's working
- Create custom **thinking spinner animations** with different speeds and phases
- Style the **user messages in the chat history** beyond the default plain gray text
- Remove the **ASCII border** from the input box
- Expand **thinking blocks** by default, so that you don't need to use the transcript (<kbd>Ctrl+O</kbd>) to see them

tweakcc also
- Fixes a bug where the **spinner animation** is frozen if you have the `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC` environment variable set ([#46](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/tweakcc/issues/46))
- Allows you to **change the context limit** (default: 200k tokens) used with models from custom Anthropic-compatible APIs with a new environment variable, `CLAUDE_CODE_CONTEXT_LIMIT`
- Adds a message to Claude Code's startup banner indicating that you're running the patched version of CC (configurable)

Additionally, we're working on features that will allow you to
- Pick from over **70+ spinning/thinking animations** from [`cli-spinners`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/cli-spinners)
- Apply **custom styling** to the markdown elements in Claude's responses like code, bold, headers, etc

tweakcc supports Claude Code installed on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**, both **native/binary installations** and those installed via npm, yarn, bun, Homebrew/Linuxbrew, nvm, fnm, n, volta, nvs, and nodenv, as well as custom locations.

Run without installation:

```bash
$ bunx tweakcc
```

## How it works

tweakcc works by patching Claude Code's minified `cli.js` file.  For bun-based installations this file is modified directly, but for native installation it's extracted from the binary, patched, and then the binary is repacked.  When you update your Claude Code installation, your customizations will be overwritten, but they're remembered in your configuration file, so they can be reapplied by just running `bunx tweakcc --apply`.

tweakcc is verified to work with Claude Code **2.0.36**.

### Configuration directory

tweakcc stores its configuration files in one of the following locations, in order of priority:

1. **`~/.tweakcc/`** - If this directory already exists, it will always be used for backward compatibility; or if `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not set
2. **`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tweakcc`** - If `~/.tweakcc/` doesn't exist and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set

## Building from source

You can use tweakcc by running `bunx tweakcc`, or `bun install -g tweakcc` and then `tweakcc`.  Or build and run it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Piebald-AI/tweakcc.git
cd tweakcc
bun install
bun build
node dist/index.js
```

## CLI Options

tweakcc supports several command-line options:

- **`bunx tweakcc`** - Launch interactive UI (default)
- **`bunx tweakcc --apply`** - Apply saved customizations without interactive UI
- **`bunx tweakcc --backup`** - Create a backup of the current Claude Code installation
- **`bunx tweakcc --restore`** - Restore Claude Code from backup to original state
- **`bunx tweakcc --debug`** - Enable debug mode for troubleshooting


### Backup & Restore

The `--backup` and `--restore` commands provide scripting support for backup operations:

```bash
# Create a backup before applying customizations
bunx tweakcc --backup

# Apply your customizations
bunx tweakcc --apply

# If something goes wrong, restore from backup
bunx tweakcc --restore
```

These commands work automatically with both npm installations and native/binary installations of Claude Code.

## System prompts

tweakcc allows you to customize the various parts of Claude Code's system prompt, including
- the main system prompt and any conditional bits,
- descriptions for all 17 builtin tools like `Bash`, `TodoWrite`, `Read`, etc.,
- prompts for builtin Task/Plan/Explore subagents, and
- prompts for utilities such as conversation compaction, WebFetch summarization, Bash command analysis, CLAUDE.md/output style/statusline creation, and many more.

👉 See [**Claude Code System Prompts**](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/claude-code-system-prompts) for a breakdown of all the system prompt parts, as well as a changelog and diffs for each CC version.

Because the system prompt is **dynamically composed** based on several factors, **it's not one string** that can be simply modified in a text editor.  It's a bunch of smaller strings sprinkled throughout Claude Code's source code.

tweakcc's method for modifying involves maintaining one markdown file for each individual portion of the prompt, resulting in a file for each tool description, each agent/utility prompt, and one for the main system prompt and a few more for various large notes inserted into other prompt parts.

#### How the prompt files are created

When tweakcc starts up, it downloads a list of system prompt parts for your Claude Code installation from GitHub (the [`data/prompts`](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/tweakcc/tree/main/data/prompts) folder in the tweakcc repo).  It then checks if each prompt part has a corresponding markdown file on disk, creating ones that don't exist and populating them with the default text for the version.

Simply edit the markdown files in `~/.tweakcc/system-prompts` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tweakcc/system-prompts`) and then run `bunx tweakcc --apply`.

#### What happens when Anthropic changes the prompts?

When your Claude Code installation is updated, tweakcc will automatically update all of your markdown files that correspond to parts of the system prompt that were changed in the new version, unless you've modified any of them.  But if you _did_ modify ones that Anthropic has also modified, then tweakcc will leave the ones you modified unchanged, and rely on you to resolve the conflict.

To assist you with resolving the conflicts, tweakcc will generate an HTML file that shows on the left, the diff of the change you've made, and on the right, the diff of Anthropic's changes.  That way you can recall at a glance what you've changed in the prompt, and easily see what's changed in the new prompt.  Then you can modify the markdown file for the prompt, incorporate or ignore new changes as you see fit.

> [!tip]
> Make sure to update the `ccVersion` field at the top of the file when you're done resolving the conflicts.  If you don't, tweakcc won't know that you've resolved the conflicts and will continue to report conflicts and generate the HTML diff file.  **Important:** Also note that the version you update `ccVersion` to is **not** necessarily the new version of CC that you installed; rather, it's the most recent version this particular system prompt was updated in.  Different prompt files have different most-recently-modified versions.

#### Git for version control over your customized prompts

This is a great idea, and we recommend it; in fact, we have one ourselves [here.](https://github.com/bl-ue/tweakcc-system-prompts)  It allows you to keep your modified prompt safe in GitHub or elsewhere, and you can also switch from one set of prompts to another via branches, for example.  In the future we plan to integrate git repo management for the system prompt markdown files into tweakcc.  For now you'll need to manually initialize a git repository in `~/.tweakcc` directory.  tweakcc automatically generates a recommended `.gitignore` file in that directory (which you can modify if you'd like).

## Troubleshooting

### Backup & Restore Issues

tweakcc stores a backup of your Claude Code `cli.js`/binary for when you want to revert your customizations and for reapplying patches.  Before it applies your customizations, it restores the original `cli.js`/binary so that it can start from a clean slate.  Sometimes things can get confused and your `claude` can be corrupted.

#### Common Issues

**Issue:** You may run into a situation where you have a tweakcc-patched (or maybe a formatted) `claude` but no tweakcc backup.  And then it makes a backup of that modified `claude`.  If you then try to reinstall Claude Code and apply your customizations, tweakcc will restore its backup of the old _modified_ `claude`.

**Solution:** To break out of this loop you can install a different version of Claude Code, which will cause tweakcc to discard its existing backup and take a fresh backup of the new `claude` file.  Or you can simply delete tweakcc's backup file (located at `~/.tweakcc/cli.backup.js` or `~/.tweakcc/native-binary.backup`).  If you do delete `cli.backup.js` or `native-binary.backup`, make sure you reinstall Claude Code _before_ you run tweakcc again, because if your `claude` is still the modified version, it will get into the same loop again.

**Issue:** Permission errors during backup/restore operations

**Solution:** Ensure you have write permissions to:
- Your Claude Code installation directory
- Your tweakcc configuration directory (`~/.tweakcc/` or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tweakcc`)
- The backup files themselves

You can use `chmod` to fix permissions if needed, or run with appropriate privileges.

**Issue:** Backup/restore operations fail silently

**Solution:** Use the `--debug` flag to see detailed error messages:
```bash
bunx tweakcc --backup --debug
bunx tweakcc --restore --debug
```

#### Manual Recovery

If automated restore isn't working, you can manually restore by:

1. **For bun installations:**
   ```bash
   # Restore from backup manually
   cp ~/.tweakcc/cli.js.backup.js "$(bunx which claude)"
   ```

2. **For native installations:**
   You'll need to reinstall Claude Code since native binaries are more complex to restore manually.

#### CLI Commands for Troubleshooting

Use the new CLI flags for backup/restore operations:

```bash
# Create fresh backup
bunx tweakcc --backup

# Restore to original state
bunx tweakcc --restore

# Check for errors with debug mode
bunx tweakcc --restore --debug
```

## FAQ

#### System prompts

<details>
<summary>How can I customize my Claude Code system prompts?</summary>

Run `bunx tweakcc` first, and then navigate to the `system-prompts` directory in your config directory (see [Configuration directory](#configuration-directory)), which will have just been created, in your file browser.  Each markdown file contains parts of prompts, such as the main system prompt, built-in tool descriptions, and various agent and utility prompts.  Modify any of them, and then run `bunx tweakcc --apply` or the tweakcc UI to apply your changes.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does tweakcc generate the prompt markdown files from my Claude Code installation?</summary>

No, it fetches them fresh from the [data/prompts](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/tweakcc/tree/main/data/prompts) folder in this (`tweakcc`) repo.  There is one JSON file for each Claude Code version.  When a new CC version is released, we generate a prompts file for it as soon as possible.

</details>


#### Themes

<details>
<summary>How can I customize my Claude Code theme?</summary>

Run `bunx tweakcc`, go to `Themes`, and modify existing themes or create a new one.  Then go back to the main menu and choose `Apply customizations`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why isn't all the text in Claude Code getting its color changed?</summary>

Some of the text Claude Code outputs has no coloring information at all, and unfortunately, that text is rendered using your terminal's default text foreground color and can't be customized.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Is there a way to disable colored output in Claude Code altogether?</summary>

Yes!  You can use the [`FORCE_COLOR`](https://force-color.org/) environment variable, a convention which many CLI tools including Claude Code respect.  Set it to `0` to disable colors entirely in Claude Code.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why isn't my new theme being applied?</summary>

Could you have forgotten to actually set Claude Code's theme to your new theme?  Run `claude` and then use `/theme` to switch to your new theme if so.

</details>

#### Other

<details>
<summary>tweakcc vs. tweakcn...?</summary>

[tweakcn](https://github.com/jnsahaj/tweakcn), though similarly named, is unrelated to tweakcc or Claude Code.  It's a tool for editing your [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) themes.  Check it out!
